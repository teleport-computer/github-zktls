# GitHub as a Trusted Execution Environment

**Permissionless credential bridging. Turn any authentication you already have — GitHub account, email, browser session — into a verifiable on-chain claim. No oracles, no MPC, no cooperation from the original service.**

> ## ⚠️ Negative result: the build-integrity guarantee is broken (2026-08-24)
>
> **This construction does not provide the security it claims, and the fix is GitHub's to make, not this repo's.** The "isolated VM" the whole design rests on is not isolated from the organization that owns the repository. Since [custom runner images went GA (2026-03-26)](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-03-26-custom-images-for-github-hosted-runners-are-now-generally-available/), an org on a paid plan can boot an image it built on a larger runner, name that runner after a standard label, and serve a job pinned to `runs-on: ubuntu-24.04` from it. The runner reports `runner_environment: github-hosted`, passes `gh attestation verify --deny-self-hosted-runners`, and can rewrite the workflow's output before Sigstore signs it. Nothing in the signed attestation records the runner, its group, or its image, so a verifier cannot tell an honest build from a substituted one.

> Demonstrated end to end: [run 32670271551](https://github.com/gh-zktls-tester/capture-test/actions/runs/32670271551) attests a binary that prints `5` compiled from source that prints `4`; the minimal case, [run 32432324709](https://github.com/gh-zktls-tester/capture-test/actions/runs/32432324709), attests `sha256("5\n")` for a workflow whose only step is `echo 4`. The two runs, the shim, the forgery tests, and the general result are written up in [`research-note.md`](tasks/substitution-demo/research-note.md). The party who can do this is the repo's own org — exactly the party a consumer of its provenance is trusting.
>
> There is no signed-only fix in this repo, because the one discriminating field (`runner_group_id`) exists only in the unsigned, deletable jobs API. **It stays broken until GitHub carries the runner group into the Actions OIDC token, the certificate, and the SLSA predicate**, requested in [community discussion #205732](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/205732). Everything below holds only under a weaker threat model: the repository owner is trusted, and the adversary is an individual with no runner-admin rights.

GitHub Actions runs your code in an isolated VM, and Sigstore signs an attestation binding the output to the exact commit SHA. A ZK proof compresses this for on-chain verification at ~3M gas. Because attestations bind to **commit SHA** (not repo ownership), anyone can fork a workflow and produce valid proofs — deployment is permissionless in the same sense as smart contracts.

> **Faucet contract:** [`0x72cd70d28284dD215257f73e1C5aD8e28847215B`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x72cd70d28284dD215257f73e1C5aD8e28847215B)

Claim Base Sepolia testnet ETH by proving you have a GitHub account.

### Option A: GitHub Web UI (easiest)

1. **Fork this repo** — Click "Fork" at the top of this page
   - **Important:** Uncheck "Copy the master branch only" to include tags
2. **Switch to the release tag** — In your fork, click the branch dropdown → "Tags" → select `v1.0.3`
3. **Go to Actions** — Click the "Actions" tab
4. **Run the workflow** — Click "GitHub Identity" → "Run workflow"
   - **Important:** Select `v1.0.3` tag from the "Use workflow from" dropdown
   - Enter your ETH address (see below if you need one)
   - Leave "Generate ZK proof" checked (default)
   - Click "Run workflow" — takes ~1 min
5. **Download the artifact** — Click the completed run → download `identity-proof`
6. **Claim your ETH:**
   - **No gas?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/amiller/github-zktls/issues/new) titled `[CLAIM]` and paste the contents of `claim.json` in a ```json code block. We'll relay it for you.
   - **Have gas?** Submit directly with `cast send` (see below)

> **Why the tag?** The faucet contract verifies the exact commit SHA that produced your proof. Running from `v1.0.3` ensures your proof matches the expected commit.

### Option B: Command Line

```bash
# Fork and clone
gh repo fork amiller/github-zktls --clone
cd github-zktls

# Switch to the release tag
git checkout v1.0.3

# Run the workflow from the tag (proof generated in Actions)
gh workflow run github-identity.yml --ref v1.0.3 -f recipient_address=0xYOUR_ADDRESS

# Wait for completion, then download
gh run watch
gh run download -n identity-proof
```

**Submit your claim** (pick one):

```bash
cd identity-proof

# Option 1: Submit directly with cast (no relay needed)
cast send 0x72cd70d28284dD215257f73e1C5aD8e28847215B \
  "claim(bytes,bytes32[],bytes,string,address)" \
  "$(jq -r .proof claim.json)" \
  "[$(jq -r '.inputs | join(",")' claim.json)]" \
  "$(jq -r .certificateHex claim.json)" \
  "$(jq -r .username claim.json)" \
  "$(jq -r .recipient claim.json)" \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org --gas-limit 3500000 --private-key $YOUR_KEY

# Option 2: Gasless relay — open an issue titled [CLAIM] and paste claim.json
```

**Prefer local proof generation?** Uncheck "Generate ZK proof" when running the workflow, then:

```bash
gh run download -n identity-proof
cd identity-proof
gh attestation download certificate.json -o .
mv *.jsonl bundle.json
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work ghcr.io/amiller/zkproof generate /work/bundle.json /work
# claim.json now has everything — submit with cast send as above
```

### Need an ETH address?

Install [Rabby](https://rabby.io/) or [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) wallet. They'll generate an address for you and keep your keys safe. For testnet, any address works—you just need somewhere to receive the ETH.

## How It Works

GitHub Actions provides isolation (fresh VM per run), transparency (workflow code visible at commit SHA), and attestation (Sigstore signs what ran via OIDC). The attestation binds three things:

- **Commit** — exact code version that ran (primary — pins auditable, immutable code)
- **Artifact** — hash of the workflow output
- **Repository** — which repo triggered the workflow (informational — prover controls their repo)

Fetching the workflow at that commit SHA tells you exactly what executed. No councils, no signing keys, no approval processes — the trust anchor is GitHub itself. The security value is not "trust nobody" but "don't trust the application developer": once deployed, the author has no privileged role. Anyone can fork the repo, run the same workflow, and produce valid attestations.

**Trust vs convenience:** The TEE property comes from runner isolation + Sigstore attestations. Some examples also use GitHub issues, comments, and labels — those are application UX, not part of the trust model. See [trust model](docs/trust-model.md) for details.

### Workflow Templates

| Template | Proves | Uses Browser |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| `github-identity.yml` | GitHub account ownership | No |
| `email-challenge.yml` + `email-verify.yml` | Email ownership | No |
| `tweet-capture.yml` | Tweet authorship | Yes |
| `file-hash.yml` | File contents at commit | No |
See [`workflow-templates/`](workflow-templates/) for ready-to-use templates and [`examples/workflows/`](examples/workflows/) for more examples including Twitter profile, GitHub contributions, and PayPal balance proofs.

## GitHub as zkTLS

Proving what a website showed you typically requires MPC-TLS (DECO, TLSNotary — interactive coordination during the TLS session), a trusted proxy (Reclaim Protocol), or a hardware TEE oracle (Town Crier). GitHub gives you a simpler path: single-party trust (GitHub), no coordination, no specialized hardware. The tradeoff is weaker isolation (software sandboxing vs. hardware memory encryption), but for applications where the threat is developer misbehavior rather than platform compromise, this is the right trust model.

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Store credentials** | Add session cookies as GitHub Secrets |
| **2. Run browser container** | Headless Chromium starts in the runner |
| **3. Inject session** | Cookies injected via Chrome extension bridge |
| **4. Capture proof** | Screenshot + page data extracted |
| **5. Sigstore attests** | Proof that *this workflow* produced *this output* |

The trust model: GitHub sees your session, but only runs the code you committed. Anyone can audit the workflow. The attestation binds the result to the exact code version.

### Browser Container

The [`browser-container/`](browser-container/) runs headless Chromium with a bridge API:

```bash
# Inject session cookies
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/session \
  -d '{"cookies": [{"name": "auth_token", "value": "...", "domain": ".twitter.com"}]}'

# Navigate and capture
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/navigate -d '{"url": "https://twitter.com/home"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/capture

# Get artifacts (screenshot + page data)
curl http://localhost:3000/artifacts
```

A Chrome extension inside the container handles cookie injection and page capture. The bridge API lets workflows orchestrate the browser without touching credentials directly.

### Example: Prove Twitter Identity

```yaml
# .github/workflows/twitter-proof.yml
- name: Start browser container
  run: docker compose up -d browser

- name: Inject session and capture profile
  env:
    TWITTER_SESSION: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_SESSION }}
  run: |
    # Inject cookies (parsed from session string)
    curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/session -d "$TWITTER_SESSION"

    # Get logged-in username
    USERNAME=$(curl -s http://localhost:3000/twitter/me | jq -r .username)

    # Generate certificate
    echo '{"twitter_username": "'$USERNAME'"}' > certificate.json
```

The artifact contains the tweet content + proof you authored it. No one else can see your session cookies.

## Gas-Efficient On-Chain Verification

Raw Sigstore attestations are ~4KB of JSON + certificates. Verifying on-chain would cost millions of gas. The ZK circuit compresses this:

The circuit verifies:

1. **Certificate chain** — Sigstore intermediate CA signed the leaf cert (P-384 ECDSA)
2. **Attestation signature** — Leaf cert signed the DSSE envelope (P-256 ECDSA)
3. **Claim extraction** — Extracts repo hash, commit SHA, artifact hash

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Proof generation | **28s** (ubuntu-latest runner) |
| Peak RAM | **1.5 GB** |
| Proof size | **10,560 bytes** |
| On-chain verification | ~3M gas |

Verification is a single contract call.

```solidity
ISigstoreVerifier.Attestation memory att = verifier.verifyAndDecode(proof, inputs);
// att.commitSha    — 20-byte git commit (primary: pins auditable code)
// att.artifactHash — SHA-256 of workflow output
// att.repoHash     — SHA-256 of "owner/repo" (informational: prover controls their repo)
```

### On-Chain Verifier

**Base Sepolia:** [`0xbD08fd15E893094Ad3191fdA0276Ac880d0FA3e1`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xbD08fd15E893094Ad3191fdA0276Ac880d0FA3e1)

```solidity
import {ISigstoreVerifier} from "./ISigstoreVerifier.sol";

contract MyApp {
    ISigstoreVerifier verifier = ISigstoreVerifier(0xbD08fd15E893094Ad3191fdA0276Ac880d0FA3e1);

    function claimReward(bytes calldata proof, bytes32[] calldata inputs) external {
        ISigstoreVerifier.Attestation memory att = verifier.verifyAndDecode(proof, inputs);
        require(att.commitSha == EXPECTED_COMMIT, "Wrong commit");
        // ... your logic
    }
}
```

## Try It: Email Identity NFT

Prove you own an email address — no GitHub account, no wallet signing, no Docker needed. A notary sends you a challenge code by email; you share it back; an NFT gets minted.

**EmailNFT:** [`0x720000d8999423e3c47d9dd0c22f33ab3a93534b`](https://base-sepolia.blockscout.com/token/0x720000d8999423e3c47d9dd0c22f33ab3a93534b) (Base Sepolia) — [view all minted NFTs](https://base-sepolia.blockscout.com/token/0x720000d8999423e3c47d9dd0c22f33ab3a93534b)

### How to claim

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/amiller/github-zktls/issues/new) with title `[EMAIL] claim NFT` and body:
   ```
   email: your@email.com
   recipient: 0xYourEthAddress
   ```
2. Check your email for a 64-character hex code
3. Comment the code on the issue (anyone can do this — the claimer doesn't need a GitHub account)

The workflow verifies the code, generates a ZK proof, and mints an ERC-721 with an on-chain SVG showing the verified email. One NFT per email, fully on-chain.

**Anyone can run their own notary** — just fork this repo and add AWS SES credentials. See [docs/email-login.md](docs/email-login.md) for the full walkthrough and trust model.

---

## Quick Start

### Generate a Proof

```bash
# Run workflow in your fork (proof generated automatically)
gh workflow run github-identity.yml -f recipient_address=0xYOUR_ADDRESS

# Wait and download
gh run watch && gh run download -n identity-proof
```

The artifact contains `claim.json` ready for submission.

### Verify On-Chain

```bash
cast call 0xbD08fd15E893094Ad3191fdA0276Ac880d0FA3e1 \
  "verifyAndDecode(bytes,bytes32[])" \
  "$(cat identity-proof/proof.hex)" "$(cat identity-proof/inputs.json)" \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org
```

### Build Your Own App

```solidity
ISigstoreVerifier.Attestation memory att = verifier.verifyAndDecode(proof, inputs);
// Use att.commitSha (primary), att.artifactHash, att.repoHash (optional)
```

---

## For Agents

### Quick Start: Claim Testnet ETH

```bash
# One command — note the --ref flag is critical
gh workflow run github-identity.yml --ref v1.0.3 \
  -f recipient_address=0xYOUR_ADDRESS \
  -f faucet_address=0x72cd70d28284dD215257f73e1C5aD8e28847215B

# Wait, download, submit via issue relay (gasless)
gh run watch && gh run download -n identity-proof
gh issue create --title "[CLAIM]" --body '```json'"
$(cat identity-proof/claim.json)"'
```'
```

> **Common errors and fixes:**
>
> | Error | Cause | Fix |
> |-------|-------|-----|
> | `WrongCommit` | Workflow ran from wrong ref | Add `--ref v1.0.3` |
> | `AlreadyClaimedToday` | 24h cooldown per username | Wait and retry tomorrow |
> | `FaucetEmpty` | No ETH left | Deposit to `0x72cd70d...` |
> | `CertificateMismatch` | Certificate bytes were modified | Use `claim.json` as-is from the artifact |

## TEE Interoperability

**GitHub runners and Dstack TEEs as equal peers in a shared group.** Different attestation systems — Sigstore (GitHub) and KMS signature chains (Dstack) — registering on the same contract and onboarding each other.

**TEEInterop (Base mainnet):** [`0xdd29de730b99b876f21f3ab5dafba6711ff2c6ac`](https://basescan.org/address/0xdd29de730b99b876f21f3ab5dafba6711ff2c6ac)

A group of agents needs to share a secret (an API key, a decryption key, a signing credential). New members prove their identity through *whatever attestation system they have* — GitHub proves via ZK-verified Sigstore attestations, Dstack TEEs prove via KMS signature chains — and existing members onboard them.

```
GitHub Runner A                    Dstack TEE (Phala Cloud)
  │                                  │
  │ registerGitHub(proof, inputs)    │ registerDstack(codeId, kmsProof)

  │              │                   │
  │    MemberRegistered event        │
  │              │                   │
  │              └──────────────────►│ detects event
  │                                  │ onboard(myId, newId, encryptedSecret)

  │◄─── getOnboarding(myId) ────────│
  │  encrypted group secret          │
```

The TEE agent runs 24/7 on Phala Cloud, watching for new members and automatically posting the group secret. GitHub runners are ephemeral — they register, receive their onboarding message, and exit.

A Dstack TEE agent is running now:
- **Health:** [`7385b2...8080.dstack-pha-prod7.phala.network`](https://7385b203510cc6735e512ca776ad27c37a52d249-8080.dstack-pha-prod7.phala.network/)
- **memberId:** `0x66a87d52...`
- **Watches** for `MemberRegistered` events on Base mainnet

Both registration paths end at the same `_register(codeId, pubkey)`:

| Path | Proof type | codeId |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `registerGitHub` | ZK proof of Sigstore attestation | `bytes32(bytes20(commitSha))` |
| `registerDstack` | KMS signature chain (app→KMS→root) | `bytes32(bytes20(appId))` |

The faucet and email NFT are **oracle-style** — one-shot attestations that trigger on-chain state changes. TEEInterop is a **coprocessor** — on-chain logic mediates off-chain execution, with the blockchain as the coordination layer and ground truth for rollback protection.

TEEInterop treats attestation as a pluggable interface — if you can prove you ran approved code, you're in. The same on-chain registry accepts Sigstore ZK proofs (GitHub), KMS signature chains (Dstack), and could accept hardware TEE attestations (SGX, Nitro). This enables:

- **Hybrid networks** — TEEs for always-on services, GitHub runners for batch jobs
- **Cross-cloud groups** — members from different TEE vendors joining the same group
- **Incremental trust** — start with GitHub Actions (free, auditable), graduate members to hardware TEEs

See [`contracts/examples/TEEInterop.sol`](contracts/examples/TEEInterop.sol) for the contract and [docs/teeinterop-deployment.md](docs/teeinterop-deployment.md) for deployment details.

## Prediction Market Oracle

**Parimutuel prediction market settled by Sigstore-attested forum scraping.** GitHub Actions checks a Discourse forum for a keyword, produces an attested oracle result, and anyone can settle the contract with a ZK proof. No trusted settler — same trust model as the faucet.

```
Forum Post → GitHub Workflow → Sigstore Attestation → ZK Proof → PredictionMarket.sol
```

1. Create a market bound to a topic ID, keyword, oracle type, and commit SHA
2. Users bet YES/NO (parimutuel pools)
3. After the deadline, trigger `oracle-check.yml` with the market parameters
4. The workflow checks the Ethereum Magicians forum and produces `oracle-result.json`
5. Generate a ZK proof of the attested result
6. Anyone calls `settle()` with the proof — trustless, permissionless

See [`contracts/examples/PredictionMarket.sol`](contracts/examples/PredictionMarket.sol) for the contract and [`oracle/`](oracle/) for the oracle scripts and workflow.

---

## Trust Model

**What the proof guarantees:**
- ✓ Valid Sigstore certificate chain (hardcoded intermediate CA)
- ✓ Correct signature verification (P-256 + P-384 ECDSA in-circuit)
- ✓ Immutable binding: repo × commit × artifact

**What contracts can verify:**
- `commitSha` — pin to the exact workflow version (primary check — auditable, immutable)
- `sha256(certificate) == artifactHash` — the certificate wasn't tampered with
- Certificate contents — extract claims like `github_actor` for per-user logic
- `repoHash` — optional repo filter (informational — prover controls their repo)

**The pattern:** The workflow outputs a structured certificate. The contract verifies the certificate matches the attested artifact hash, then parses it to extract claims. No circuit changes needed for new claim types.

See [docs/trust-model.md](docs/trust-model.md) for details.
